# MU-Net
This is an implementation of our paper: A Multi-Scale Framework with Unsupervised Learning for Remote Sensing Image Registration
![Proposed Framework in the Paper](https://github.com/yeyuanxin110/MU-Net/blob/main/githubPic/MU-Net.png)
## Environmental Preparation
Our code is performed in Pytorch 1.8.0 basis on Python 3.8. 

If you want to train the network by using loss function based on CFOG, you may need to install matlab calling program in your Python. (Refer Call MATLAB from Python https://ww2.mathworks.cn/help/matlab/matlab-engine-for-python.html?lang=en).
